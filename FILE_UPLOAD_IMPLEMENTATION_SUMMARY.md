# 📁 File Upload System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete Success! 

I have successfully implemented a **complete file upload system** that allows users to upload supporting documents (like medical certificates) when submitting leave requests through the Flutter mobile app.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **📤 File Upload API Endpoint** ✅
- **Location**: `src/app/api/upload/documents/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Handles multipart file uploads
  - Validates file size (max 10MB)
  - Validates file types (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, GIF, TXT)
  - Uploads to Supabase storage
  - Returns secure public URLs
  - Full CORS support for mobile app

### 2. **🏗️ Supabase Storage Configuration** ✅
- **Storage Bucket**: `documents` bucket created with public access
- **File Organization**: Files stored in `userId/documentType_timestamp.extension` format
- **Security**: 10MB file size limit, restricted file types
- **Access**: Public URLs for easy retrieval

### 3. **📝 Enhanced Leave Request API** ✅
- **Location**: `src/app/api/leave/request/route.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - Now accepts `supportingDocumentsUrls` array
  - Stores document URLs in `supporting_documents_urls` column
  - Uses direct database insert (bypassed conflicting RPC functions)
  - Proper working days calculation
  - Full error handling and validation

### 4. **📱 Flutter Mobile App Integration** ✅
- **New Service**: `FileUploadService` for handling uploads
- **Dependencies**: Added `file_picker: ^8.0.0+1` package
- **UI Enhancement**: Enhanced leave request dialog with:
  - File picker interface
  - Upload progress indication
  - File type validation
  - Document preview
  - Error handling
  - Remove file option

### 5. **🌐 Database Schema Updates** ✅
- **Column**: `supporting_documents_urls` (string array) in `leave_applications` table
- **Storage**: Documents stored as public URLs accessible via HTTPS
- **Integration**: Fully integrated with existing leave management system
